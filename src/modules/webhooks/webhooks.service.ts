 * the webhook and creating another. That changes the id and discards the
 * delivery history, which is a lot to give up to replace a credential.
 *
 * Rotation writes nothing but `secret`: the id, URL, enabled flag and every
 * WebhookDelivery row survive untouched. dispatchWebhooks reads the secret per
 * dispatch, so the next delivery is signed with the new one with no restart
 * and no cache to invalidate.
 *
 * There is no overlap window where both secrets are accepted — the signature
 * is computed by us and verified by the receiver, so the cutover is whenever
 * the receiver updates its copy. A creator rotating a *leaked* secret wants
 * the old one dead immediately, which is the stronger requirement; a creator
 * rotating routinely can disable the webhook first (PATCH /webhooks/:id),
 * update both sides, then re-enable.
 *
 * `secret` accepts a caller-supplied value for symmetry with registration, so
